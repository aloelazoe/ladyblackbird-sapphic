{\textsc{\fontsize{14}{0}\fontcelestiaantiqua \phantom{.....} Adrift in the Blue}} \vspace{4pt} \\
\phantom{.....} The worlds of the Wild Blue float in a sky of breathable gases
circling a small, cold star. Scholars believe that the star is made from
pure Essence—the strange energy that sorcerers channel for their magic.
This “solar system” is much smaller than you might think—it takes about
six weeks to cross from one side to the other on a standard sky ship. Most
of the worlds of the Empire are so closely positioned that it takes only a
day or two to travel from one to another. \vspace{10pt} \\
{\fontsize{14}{0} \textsc{The Lower Depths}} \vspace{4pt} \\
The heavier gases form a dense layer of fog below the “sky” of the Wild
Blue. This fog is corrosive —people need to wear gas-masks to breathe
and most airship hulls will start to corrode after a single exposure.
Pirates and other criminals sometimes use the lower depths to evade
Imperial patrols and launch raids from hiding. Unfortunately, the depths
are home to sky squid and other monstrous things.... \vspace{5pt} \\

{\fontsize{14}{0} \textsc{Ilysium}} \vspace{4pt} \\
The capitol world of the Empire, home to the great noble \\ houses.
Ilysium is rich and decadent, attended by servants, slaves, and the elite
bodyguards of the nobility. \vspace{5pt} \\
{\fontsize{14}{0} \textsc{Olympia}} \vspace{4pt} \\
The staging world of the Imperial Sky Fleet. From here, expeditions are
launched into the colonial expanse and all across the Wild Blue. Olympia
is also home to the finest brewers and distillers in the Empire. \vspace{5pt} \\
{\fontsize{14}{0} \textsc{Haven}} \vspace{4pt} \\
The most prominent of the Free Worlds. Here, in the sprawling city hubs,
the Trade Union tries to impose some order on the bickering clans and
factions of the Free Peoples. Slavery is outlawed here, so many ex-slaves
make Haven their home. \vspace{5pt} \\
{\fontsize{14}{0} \textsc{Nightport}} \vspace{4pt} \\
Unlike other worlds, Nightport does not rotate, which means one face is
always in darkness. It is on this side that pirates and smugglers have built
a hidden port city in which to carry out their nefarious dealings. This
hive of scum and villainy is a dangerous place, but almost anything may
be bought or sold there, including secrets. \vspace{5pt} \\
{\fontsize{14}{0} \textsc{The Remnants}} \vspace{4pt} \\
A swirling maelstrom of spinning world-shards. The Remnants are
almost impossible to navigate, even for the best airship pilots. It’s said
that the pirate queen, Aria Flame, keeps her secret fortress somewhere
deep within the Remnants and only those who know the secret of
the true course can ever reach it.
